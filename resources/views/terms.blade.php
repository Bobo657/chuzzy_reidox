Every deposit is considered to be a private transaction between {{ config('app.name')}} and its Members.</p>

                        <p>As a private transaction, this program is authorized by the 40 Act or the ICA, UK Investment Company Act of 1940 and all other rules, regulations and amendments thereof.

This payment has to be an external payment of bitcoin as the use of already existing balance doesn’t work because it is locked up and used for trading activities.
